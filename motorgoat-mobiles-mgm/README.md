This is, MotorGOAT-Mobiles, an app that users can go to buy and sell cars, trucks, and suvs, with ease!

On this app a user will be be able to use the search bar to shop for any kind of vehicle by type, year, make, model, and price!

This app comes with an easy-to-use, well designed navigation bar located right under the search bar!

The navigation bar contains 5 client side routes (pages) that help the user navigate to find their dream ride!

The navigation bar is set with categories of different types of vehicles: Cars, Trucks and SUVs. Feel free to search with ease by leaving your search words in the search bar as you shop each page. For instance, if you are a Toyota person, leave 'Toyota' in the search bar as you browse through the different pages of vehicles to only see the Toyota selections!

While shopping, if you find a listing you like, go ahead and click the green 'Available!' button conviently located above each listing image and it will turn red to mark your new car as 'Sold!'. Feel free to buy more than one vehicle and mark them as 'Sold!' as well. If you change your mind and find something better, go ahead and click the red 'Sold!' button to change it back to 'Available!' for other users!

The other 2 pages include the 'Home' page, where you can easily return to the home page to restart your searching journey!

The last page is created to help you make some money! This is the 'Sell Your Car Here!!' page, and it's exactly what it sounds like. Navigate to this page to list your vehicle by filling out the form with the 'type', 'year', 'make', 'model', 'price', and a url for an image of the vehicle so that shoppers can have all the info they need to buy it!

After you've filled out the form, click on the 'Sell!' button to see your nicely designed listing. Keep checking back to this page to see if someone has bought your vehicle when the green 'Available!' button turns to a red 'Sold!' button!
